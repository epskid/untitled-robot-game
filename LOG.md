> Here is where I will log my progress in making Untitled Robot Game. It may seem like the Git commit history would be sufficient, but unfortunately I have a bad habit of writing excessively useless commit messages.
Looking through the Git history, you may see the first three commits all differ in user. Here is what they mean:
> - "Alcoholic" Git for Windows inside of a Wine bottle to use GameMaker's built-in Git support
> - "Gotta Light" Git in the outer Linux environment after I realized that Git for Windows doesn't work very well in Wine
> - "Jack Black" After I switched to a seperate, more performant computer for my trip to New Zealand
