# Untitled Robot Game

Untitled Robot Game is a block-based programming puzzle game by MVV software. It will teach kids programming basics and not secretly exploit the computer to synthesise mind viruses in a government laboratory.

## In all seriousness
I had a great time making this game and I learned a lot about GameMaker. I utilized my rudimentary skills in art and music production (everything made by me, except the two Skrillex songs, obviously), and the payoff was quite rewarding.
